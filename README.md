# OvScore
This site is intended to help doctors find out whether they should take the surgical or non-surgical approach based on the patient's conditions. This site uses the AGO, the iModel, and the Fagotti scoring system. After selecting one of the scoring system, the site will give a prompt for the doctor to respond to. Once selecting enough responses, a recommendation will be given.
